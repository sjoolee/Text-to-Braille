# Text-to-Braille Converter

Despite much of Canadian infrastructure being built with accessibility in mind, there are many
aspects of navigating the world that are not built for people with visual disabilities. The See+ device is an
automatic image-to-braille conversion device that provides an intuitive solution for the issues associated
with digital or physical media such as street signs, posters, and advertisements. The device processes the
text read from an image and outputs the corresponding braille pattern by the actuation of small pins.
Before investing in the fabrication and sale of such a product, we must confirm the project is worth
pursuing. This analysis has been done in three parts: verification, risk analysis, and economic analysis. As
a whole, this analysis begs the question “What should be done, and how?”.
Design verification rules out pursuing a project that either does not work or would require
unacceptable modifications in order to work. See+ focuses on the two most important design inputs:
translation accuracy and user-initiated translation. Without verification of these design inputs, there is no
cause to move forward with the design. In contrast, clear and rigorous verification may suggest that the
design in its current scope should be further developed. A satisfactory translation accuracy was met by
confirming the movement of particular servo motors. The accuracy rate in our testing suggests that this
crucial feature is indeed worth broadening in scope, but more tests must be run in this context. The second
factor that was tested was user-initiated translation. This was verified with a push button input which
permitted the translation of a character loaded in the software. Once again, the high accuracy in testing
suggests that this feature works as intended, encouraging further testing to confirm this.
Risk analysis provides designers with assurance that the product’s associated hazards are not
significant enough to warrant halting its current development. Risk is the combination of an event’s
severity and frequency. A highly severe outcome with a high enough likelihood may suggest the current
design must be vastly altered. Three identified risk factors have a rating of “unacceptable”. First, the
remote outcome of structural failure between the motor and pin would render the device useless.
Inaccurate image reading has the same outcome and probability. The final scenario is electrical damage,
which may have the catastrophic outcome of posing a health risk to the user, rendering the failure mode
unacceptable despite its low likelihood. Sufficient risk mitigation was done to ensure that in a final,
market-ready device, there will be no risk that is too severe or likely to be acceptable. It can be confirmed
that a device that meets all initially outlined requirements will be successful in mitigating each of these
unacceptable risks. These descriptions give confidence to the conclusion that the risks of See+ are
manageable and that further development should continue. As development continues, these risks should
be at the forefront of design decisions to ensure no addition compromises device safety and operation.
The company must also profit to make investing in improving production, manufacturing, and
innovation worthwhile. Two in-house manufacturing alternatives were evaluated against not pursuing the
product: 3D printing, and injection moulding. According to the analysis, manufacturing with 3D printing
is a conservative approach limited by production speed. This results in a present worth of more than
$100,000 for a 5-year timeline. Injection moulding results in a more aggressive, risky approach. It
features higher initial costs and a high production rate. The injection molding model results in a present
worth of more than $200,000, but was deemed a less appropriate choice because it requires an initial loan
of more than $500,000. This loan is simply unrealistic for a brand-new company with no prior sales. Both
options are financially advantageous when compared to not pursuing the project, with a preference for the
more conservative and realistic pathway toward this profit: 3D printing.
To conclude, all facets of our analysis suggest that the product design as it currently exists should
be further pursued, with the economics suggesting manufacturing with 3D printing.
